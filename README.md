# Royal Himalayan Coffee

Royal Himalayan Coffee Company grows 100% Highland Specialty Arabica Nepali Coffee. Our coffee beans are cultivated at altitudes above 1300 meters from sea level, approximately 55 km north of Kathmandu in the region known as Sindhupalchwok. The high altitude, in close proximity to the Himalayan range, provides a unique environment for coffee growth, although heavy frost in winter can adversely affect the coffee trees.
